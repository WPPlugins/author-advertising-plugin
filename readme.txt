== Description ==

This plugin allows blog admins to create a revenue sharing program utilising one of the many advertising programs out there i.e Yahoo, Google Adsense, Amazon, Allposters etc. It can also be used as a banner manager, author photo/website widgets.. actually it has about a zillion uses. Give it a try and lemme know if you use it for anything really groovy.

See the Author Advertising Plugin page for more detailed information on how to use this plugin.

Admin has complete control over:

* The percentage of author adverts to admin adverts.
* The user level that an author has to be before they get to participate in the revenue sharing program.
* Whether to randomise author ads on the front page of the blog.
* The page that authors see before entering their publisher id.
* Custom fields where you can collect additional information from your authors and display it.
* The positioning and content of ads.
* Up to three Author Advertising widgets.
* The information that authors enter.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I want to use Adsense as my advertising program? =

You modify the Author Page and let your users know that you're using Adsense. You check one of the custom fields and give it the title of Adsense Slot ID or something similar. Then the author will put their publisher ID and slot ID information into their page. Remember to put your own defaults in the custom default slots so that your own ads show properly. Check out the manual (included with the zip and also linked from the plugin options page) for more help on setting up Adsense.

= Can I use this for more than just advertising? =

Yes you can put any HTML code into the boxes. PHP won't work though. You could use this plugin to insert a widget that displays the author's picture or some other author information. It'll still rotate with your information unless you set your admin percentage to 0% then it'll just be for authors. On the front page if you randomise ads then all of your author's information/picture etc would be rotated.

= Is this plugin compatible with WordPress x.x.x? =

Quite probably.

= How can I fine-tune who gets to share in my ad revenue? =

You can use the Members plugin to create new user roles and then check out the options page again.

= Where can I get support? =

I offer free support from my website. Simply visit http://www.harleyquine.com/code and either leave a comment or email support@harleyquine.com. I'm flooded with a heap of emails every day but I'll do my best to help you out.

3. The Author Advertising user panel lets admins change or delete the information their users have stored in the db.

== Upgrade Notice ==
